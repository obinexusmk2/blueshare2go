# OBINexus BlueShare: Bluetooth Pay-As-You-Go WiFi Service

## Service Overview
Transform individual mobile data plans into shared, cost-efficient group connectivity through Bluetooth mesh networking with real-time microtransaction cost sharing.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize BlueShare service
./scripts/blueshare_init.sh

# Create a network
./scripts/create_network.sh --topology=trident --duration=3600

# Join existing network
./scripts/join_network.sh --network-id=<network_id>
```

## Architecture
- **Bluetooth LE** for device discovery and coordination
- **Mobile Hotspot** for internet connectivity sharing  
- **Lightning Network** for instant microtransactions
- **Node-Zero** for privacy-preserving usage tracking

## Topologies
- **star**: Single host for small groups (up to 3 devices)
- **bus**: Daisy chain style routing for compact groups with light redundancy
- **mesh**: Distributed multi-host routing for large host-rich groups
- **trident**: Three anchor hubs (host/relay with strong RSSI) with deterministic failover
- **hybrid**: Dynamic switching when no static topology is optimal

## OBINexus Integration
- **Division**: OBINexus Computing
- **Framework**: Hot-wiring Architecture compatible
- **Tier Access**: Open/Business/Heart levels supported
